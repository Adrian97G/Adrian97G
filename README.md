## For me itÂ´s a pleasure to have you here.

IÂ´m passionate about development, programming, and everything related to design and construction in the fascinating world of technology and the web. My focus is on Frontend development, and I have experience and knowledge in a variety of essential tools, such as:

- ðŸŽ¨ **UI/UX Design:** Work with Figma to create attractive and functional designs.
- ðŸš€ **Web Technologies:** I use **HTML**, **CSS**, **SASS**, **Tailwind** and **Bootstrap** to build polished user interfaces.
- :page_with_curl: **Javascript:** I use this dynamic programming language to add interactive functionality to my projects.
- :dart: **Vue.js:** I develop single page web applications (SPA) and progressive web applications (PWA) with this powerful framework.
- ðŸ”— **Version Control:** I master version control tools such as **Git**, **GitHub**, and **GitLab** to collaborate on projects and manage my code effectively.

If you are looking for someone who can bring creativity, technical experience, and a strong commitment to quality to your projects, do not hesitate to contact me!
